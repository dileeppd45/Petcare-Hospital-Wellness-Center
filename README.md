# Petcare-Hospital-Wellness-Center
Petcare Hospital is a web application designed to manage all pet-related services online. If the public wants to consult with a doctor for their pet’s medical care, they can do so through this platform. Doctors can provide home remedies or prescribe medicines, which the staff will then pack and deliver to the address provided by the user.
To consult with a doctor, users need to register first. The platform offers a list of available doctors, and users can choose a doctor by paying the consultation fee. They can then describe their pet’s health issue or specific needs. The chosen doctor will review the consultation and provide either a prescription or a home remedy. If a prescription is given, it will be sent to the available staff members, who will calculate the prescription bill and send it to the user. Once the user pays, the staff will pack and deliver the medicine to the specified location.

The website keeps records of users, doctors, staff, consultations, prescriptions, and all booking details in its database.

The platform is accessible to administrators, doctors, staff, and the public. Administrators manage and maintain the website, with authority over the management of doctors, staff, and hospital services.
